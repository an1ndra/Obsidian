# Development Lifecycle

This page documents the development process engineers should follow at your company. Helpful for getting new employees up to speed.

# 1. Create a branch off of `master`

Name the branch with your first name pre-pended:
`leslie/cool-feature`

# 2. Writing code

You can link to other pages in your workspace in a couple ways:

- Type `/link`, press `enter`, and type the name of the page you want. This creates a link like this one:

[Engineering Guidelines](Engineering%20Guidelines%2013158e39db3d41b3a6a2ab0921b60fd3.md)

- To create a link inline, type `@` followed by the title of the page, then press `enter`. The result looks like this: [Engineering Guidelines](Engineering%20Guidelines%2013158e39db3d41b3a6a2ab0921b60fd3.md)

# 3. Create a pull request on Github

Include the Notion task link in your PR description. 

# 4. Submit for review
