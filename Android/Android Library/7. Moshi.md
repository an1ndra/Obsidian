Moshi is a library that converts JSON into Java and Kotlin models. A lot of people refer to the Moshi as GSON 3.0. This library is superior to GSON in several aspects: [it's faster](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43578738/3920456 "StackOverflow"), it includes Kotlin support, it's maintained, it throws predictable exceptions and it doesn't use broken `DateTime` adapter by default. Plus, converting JSON to Java model (and vice-versa) is straightforward with Moshi.

```kotlin
val moshi = Moshi.Builder().build()
val jsonAdapter = moshi.adapter(Model::class.java)

/* JSON to Model */
val model = jsonAdapter.fromJson(json)

/* Model to JSON */
val json = jsonAdapter.toJson(model)
```

We also admire Moshi for its JSON API support. JSON API is the specification for building APIs, and lot of APIs we work with are written using that specification. [Moshi JSON API](https://github.com/kamikat/moshi-jsonapi) makes our life easier because it converts JSON API response into meaningful Java objects. Retrofit also has support for Moshi, and it all just clicks together.
