Room is an official Android ORM, and there are multiple reasons for that status. This library features a beautiful API that is similar to Retrofit. It also relies heavily on annotations and standard SQL syntax.

```java
@Dao
interface MovieDao {
  @Query("SELECT details FROM movies WHERE id = :id")
  fun getMovieDetails(id: String): MovieDetails
}
```

Additionally, Room includes out of the box support for Rx and “LiveData,” so you can decide to use it however you like. The main benefit Room offers over other ORMs is its simplicity. Other ORMs come with much more complex APIs that require you to read all the documentation thoroughly before you can use them. Thanks to its standard SQL syntax, Room is incredibly easy to understand, allowing you to dive in without spending hours reading the documentation.
