Retrofit is type-safe HTTP client that allows you to define your REST API as an interface. You can manipulate the API requestsâ€™ body, headers, query parameters and much more via annotations, which makes everything clean and simple. Retrofit also allows synchronous and asynchronous API calls execution.

```java
interface ApiService {
  @GET("movie/{id}")
  fun getMovieDetails(@Path("id") id: String) : Call<MovieDetails>
}
```

To top it off, Retrofit offers a separate Rx module. If you are using Rx, this module returns your API call as an Observable so you are able to chain it with the rest of your application. These are just a few of the many reasons we at Infinum still love and use Retrofit.
