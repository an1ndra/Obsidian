As you probably know by now, Android image loading and handling API is terrible. It’s a nightmare to even resize an image without getting “OutOfMemoryException.” Glide is an image loading library that exposes a nice API, allowing you to transform your image however you want.

```java
GlideApp.with(context)
  .load(url)
  .centerCrop()
  .placeholder(R.drawable.ic_placeholder)
  .into(imageView)
```

This library allows you to easily load a remote image into your ImageView, define fallback images, cache and scale your images and much more. Try accomplishing all this without Glide, and you will quickly understand why this has become our core library. It even supports some common transformations like a circular image out of the box.
