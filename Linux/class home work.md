11. simulate fcfs algo in c -- to calculate the avg of wait time and the arrival time = 0;
waiting time of the second process is the burst time of the first process ;
thrid process is the sum of burst time of 1+2 process;
after calculating all the waiting times the avg waiting as the avg of all waiting time.
