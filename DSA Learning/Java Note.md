### About Java
Java has removed many confusing and rarely-used features e.g. explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc. Java also takes care of memory management and it also provides an automatic garbage collector.==Java is an object-oriented programming language==.Java programs can create applets: Applets are programs that run in web browsers. But applets support was deprecated in Java 9 release and has been removed in Java 11 release due to warning browser support for the Java plugin.

### Java Naming Convention
-   Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.
-   Class names should be **nouns**, in mixed case with the **first** letter of each internal word capitalised. Interfaces name should also be capitalised just like class names.
-   Constant variables should be all upper case
