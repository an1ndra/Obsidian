- **Briefly discuss the Von-Neumann architecture of digital computer. Compare and contrast
the Harvard architecture with Von-Neumann architecture.**

    Von Neumann architecture is an early, influential type of computing structure. It primarily consists of memory chips that are able to both hold and process data. Each chip has the ability to perform different tasks, depending on how it is affected by the operation executed before it. In this architecture, each computer would have memory, mechanisms for output and input, a central control, a place for central arithmetic, and external storage.

    Computers with Von Neumann architecture are known as stored-program. This means that the computer does not need external switches or other influences in order to run. All instructions and data are stored in random-access memory (RAM).

    Before the Von Neumann system, computers were essentially designed rather than being programmed. Once a machine was assembled, it could only perform one function. In order to change what the computer did, it was necessary to rewire, add components, or otherwise alter the physical structure of the machine.

Represent (-7.25)10 in IEEE 754 single precision format.

- What do you mean by Computer Organization? How it related with Computer
Architecture?

    Computer organization refers to the operational units and their interconnections that realize the architectural specifications. Examples of architectural attributes include the instruction set, the number of bits used to represent various data types (e.g., numbers, characters), I/O mechanisms, and techniques for addressing memory. Organizational attributes include those hardware details transparent to the programmer, such as control signals; interfaces between the computer and peripherals; and the memory technology used.

    Now, let’s see the difference between Computer Architecture and Computer Organization:

- Explain Associative Memory. Discuss the advantages over Secondary Memory.
    - **Associative memory** is also known as content addressable memory
     (CAM) or associative storage or associative array. It is a special type
     of memory that is optimized for performing searches through data, as 
    opposed to providing a simple direct access to the data based on the 
    address.

        Associative memory of conventional semiconductor memory (usually [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-types-ram-random-access-memory/))
         with added comparison circuity that enables a search operation to 
        complete in a single clock cycle. It is a hardware search engine, a 
        special type of computer memory used in certain very high searching 
        applications.

        **Functions of the registers** used in associative memory is given below:

        - **Input Register (I)** hold the data that is to be
        written into the associative memory. It is also used to hold the data
        that is to be searched for. At a particular time it can hold a data
        containing one word of length (say n).
        - **Mask Register (M)** is used to provide a mask for
        choosing a key or particular field in the input register's word. Since
        input register can hold a data of one word of length n so the maximum
        length of mask register can be n.
        - **Select Register (S)** contains m bits, one for each
        memory words. When input data in I register is compared to key in m
        register and match is found then that particular bit is set in select
        register.
        - **Output Register (Y)** contains the matched data word that is retrieved from associative memory.

        **Applications of Associative memory** 

        1. It can be only used in memory allocation format.
        2. It is widely used in the database management systems, etc.

    - Advantages of the secondary data refer to the benefits and importance
     of using the secondarily collected record and data in a research study.
     Some of the advantages of secondary data include:

        ****Generally, the secondary data can be 
        collected very easily where researchers have to find the source of that 
        data and then collect it at all. Besides, the time and cost required to 
        collect this type of data is very lesser as compared to that of primary 
        data.

        **Ease of Access**

        **Time and Cost Effective**

        In order to access good secondary data, the marketers visit libraries
         or the places where the secondary data can be found easily. Besides, 
        internet has also made the secondary data also very much easier to 
        access and it can be said as another advantage of the secondary data.

- Explain Booth’s multiplication algorithm with a suitable flowchart. Multiply (+14) with
(-5) using Booth’s algorithm.

    ooth algorithm gives a procedure for multiplying binary integers in signed 2’s complement representation in efficient way, i.e., less number of additions/subtractions required. It operates on the fact that strings of 0’s in the multiplier require no addition but just shifting and a string of 1’s in the multiplier from bit weight 2^k to weight 2^m can be treated as 2^(k+1 ) to 2^m.

    **Hardware Implementation of Booths Algorithm –** The hardware implementation of the booth algorithm requires the register configuration shown in the figure below.

    **Booth’s Algorithm Flowchart –**

    We name the register as A, B and Q, AC, BR and QR respectively. Qn 
    designates the least significant bit of multiplier in the register QR. 
    An extra flip-flop Qn+1is appended to QR to facilitate a double 
    inspection of the multiplier.The flowchart for the booth algorithm is 
    shown below.

    ![Assignment%20f697772a23bd467bbecf55c85d985db3/Untitled%201.png](Assignment%20f697772a23bd467bbecf55c85d985db3/Untitled%201.png)

    AC and the appended bit Qn+1  are initially cleared to 0 and the 
    sequence SC is set to a number n equal to the number of bits in the 
    multiplier. The two bits of the multiplier in Qn and Qn+1are inspected. 
    If the two bits are equal to 10, it means that the first 1 in a string 
    has been encountered. This requires subtraction of the multiplicand from
     the partial product in AC. If the 2 bits are equal to 01, it means that
     the first 0 in a string of 0’s has been encountered. This requires the 
    addition of the multiplicand to the partial product in AC.

    When the two bits are equal, the partial product does not change. An 
    overflow cannot occur because the addition and subtraction of the 
    multiplicand follow each other. As a consequence, the 2 numbers that are
     added always have a opposite signs, a condition that excludes an 
    overflow. The next step is to shift right the partial product and the 
    multiplier (including Qn+1). This is an arithmetic shift right (ashr) 
    operation which AC and QR ti the right and leaves the sign bit in AC 
    unchanged. The sequence counter is decremented and the computational 
    loop is repeated n times.
