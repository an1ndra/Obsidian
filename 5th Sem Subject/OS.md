system call provide interface between process and interface

Peer to peer computing. Example : `Block chain, Torrent.`

# System Structures
Operating system services
1. User interafce: GUI, CLI, Batch interface(Batch file `.bat` and batch inteface both are same?)
2. Program execution.
3. I/O operation. usually user cant control I/O directily for protection and effiency
4. File system manipulation. File read, write execution, make, delete, search permission.
5. Communications. It warks via shared memory ot though message passing.
6. Error detection. Memory error, power failure, lack of paper in the printer
Another sets of operating system that is not helps to users but rather for ensuring the effeciency of OS.
7. Resource allocation. Memory alocation, CPU power alocation. Example: `shared server`
8. Accounting .(Is this analytics of Resource allocation?)
9. Protection and security. Protection involves ensure that all access to system resources is controlled.

# OS interface
1. Command interpreter is a Terminal?
2.  What is the relation between Linux, Unix and Kernel?
3.  What is X-windows system?
4.  Behind the scenes the functions that make up an API typically invoke(call) the actual system calls on behalf(part) of the application programmer. what does its mean?
